Unit Tests: 

Run the below commands in the terminal in the root dir of project
# npm install  // this will look inside package.json and install jest module
# npm test     // this will run a test script



Notes:

I Didn't use es6 imports:
- chrome gives a CORS error for local files. Didn't want to buden you running a webserver.
